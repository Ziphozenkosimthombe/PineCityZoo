          <h3>LION</h3>
          <p>
            The Lion (Panthera leo), often called the "King of the Jungle," is
            one of the most iconic big cats and a symbol of strength and
            courage. Unlike other cats, lions are highly social, living in
            groups called prides that consist of related females, their cubs,
            and a coalition of males. These majestic predators once roamed
            across Africa, Europe, and Asia, but today, they are primarily found
            in sub-Saharan Africa, with a small population in India's Gir
            Forest.

            Male lions are easily recognized by their impressive manes, which
            range from blond to dark brown and signal dominance and health. They
            can weigh up to 190 kg (420 lbs), while lionesses, the primary
            hunters, are slightly smaller but more agile. Lions are apex
            predators, preying on animals like zebras, wildebeests, and buffalo,
            often hunting cooperatively at night. Their powerful roars can be
            heard up to 8 km (5 miles) away, serving to mark territory and
            communicate with the pride.

          <p>
            Despite their fearsome reputation, lions spend much of their day
            restingâ€”up to 20 hours! Cubs are born spotted for camouflage and
            rely on the pride for protection. Sadly, lions are classified as
            vulnerable, with populations declining due to habitat loss,
            human-wildlife conflict, and poaching.

          <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
          <p>
            You can witness the regal presence of lions in Pen C5, located in
            the heart of the savannah exhibit.
