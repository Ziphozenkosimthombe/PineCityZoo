          <h3>GORILLA</h3>
          <p>
            The Gorilla (Gorilla gorilla and Gorilla beringei) is the largest of
            all living primates, sharing 98.3% of their DNA with humans. These
            powerful yet gentle giants belong to the Hominidae family, which
            also includes chimpanzees, orangutans, and humans. There are two
            species—the Western Gorilla (Gorilla gorilla) and the Eastern
            Gorilla (Gorilla beringei)—each with distinct subspecies, such as
            the Mountain Gorilla and Western Lowland Gorilla.
          </p>
          <p>
            Gorillas are known for their immense strength, with males (called
            silverbacks) weighing up to 200 kg (440 lbs) and standing 1.7 meters
            (5.5 feet) tall when upright. Despite their size, they are primarily
            herbivorous, feeding on leaves, stems, fruit, and occasionally
            insects. Their knuckle-walking locomotion and strong social bonds
            make them fascinating to observe.
          </p>

          <p>
            Gorillas live in tight-knit family groups led by a dominant
            silverback, who protects and guides the troop. They communicate
            through vocalizations, body language, and facial expressions,
            displaying complex emotions similar to humans. Sadly, gorillas are
            critically endangered due to habitat loss, poaching, and disease.

          <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
          <p>
            You can visit these magnificent primates in Pen A7, located in the
            tropical rainforest habitat zone.
