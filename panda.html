          <h3>PANDA</h3>
          <p>
            The Giant Panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) is one of the world’s most
            beloved and iconic bears, instantly recognizable by its
            black-and-white fur and gentle demeanor. Native to the mountainous
            bamboo forests of central China, pandas are a national treasure and
            a global symbol of wildlife conservation. Despite their
            classification as bears, pandas have a unique diet consisting 99% of
            bamboo, consuming up to 12-38 kg (26-84 lbs) daily to meet their
            energy needs.

            Adult pandas typically weigh 70-160 kg (150-350 lbs), with males
            being larger than females. They are mostly solitary animals,
            communicating through scent markings and occasional vocalizations.
            Females are fertile for just 2-3 days per year, making reproduction
            challenging—a key reason for their endangered status.

          <p>
            Thanks to intense conservation efforts, including breeding programs
            and habitat protection, wild panda numbers have slowly risen.
            However, they remain threatened by habitat fragmentation and climate
            change (which affects bamboo growth).
