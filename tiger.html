          <h3>PANDA</h3>
          <p>
            The Tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest of all big cats and one
            of nature’s most awe-inspiring predators. With its striking orange
            coat, black stripes (unique as fingerprints!), and powerful build,
            this solitary hunter reigns supreme across Asia’s forests,
            grasslands, and mangroves. Though once widespread, tigers now
            survive in only 6% of their historic range, with fewer than 5,000
            left in the wild.
          </p>

            ✔ Size & Strength: Males weigh 180-300 kg (400-660 lbs) and can
            leap 6-9 meters (20-30 feet) in a single bound. ✔ Stealth Hunter:
            Stripes provide camouflage, while padded paws allow silent stalking.
            ✔ Swimming Skills: Unlike most cats, tigers love water and are
            strong swimmers. ✔ Roar & Communication: Their deep roars can be
            heard 3 km (1.8 miles) away, used to mark territory.

          <p>
            Tigers are apex predators, hunting deer, wild boar, and even
            crocodiles. A single tiger needs 50-60 large prey animals per year,
            requiring vast territories. Sadly, poaching (for skins/bone trade)
            and habitat loss have pushed tigers to near extinction, with three
            subspecies already gone forever.

          <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
          <p>
            Observe these majestic cats in Pen D9, our Asian forest exhibit,
            designed with pools and climbing structures to mimic their natural
            habitat.
