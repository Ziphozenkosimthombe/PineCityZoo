          <h3>KOALA</h3>
          <p>
            The Koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) is one of Australia’s most
            beloved marsupials, known for its fluffy ears, spoon-shaped nose,
            and sleepy demeanor. Despite often being called a "koala bear," this
            adorable creature is not a bear at all—it’s a marsupial, related to
            kangaroos and wombats. Koalas are perfectly adapted to life in
            eucalyptus forests, where they spend up to 20 hours a day resting
            and 2-4 hours feeding.
          </p>
          <p>
            Koalas have a highly specialized diet, eating only certain types of
            eucalyptus leaves, which are toxic to most animals. Their sharp
            claws and strong limbs help them climb trees with ease, while their
            thick fur protects them from harsh weather. An adult koala can weigh
            4-15 kg (9-33 lbs), with males being larger than females. One of
            their most distinctive features is their loud, deep bellow, used by
            males to communicate territory.

          <p>
            These solitary animals are mostly active at night and live in home
            ranges that overlap with other koalas. Sadly, koalas are facing
            habitat loss, bushfires, and disease, leading to their
            classification as an endangered species in some regions.
