          <h3>GIRAFFA</h3>
          <p>
            The Giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis) is the world’s tallest land
            mammal, belonging to the family Giraffidae. With their incredibly
            long necks, distinctive spotted coats, and towering legs, giraffes
            are one of Africa’s most iconic animals. There are four recognized
            species, including the Masai giraffe, Reticulated giraffe, Northern
            giraffe, and Southern giraffe, each with unique coat patterns.
          </p>
          <p>
            A giraffe’s neck alone can measure up to 2.4 meters (8 feet) and
            contains only seven vertebrae—the same number as humans! Their long,
            prehensile tongues (up to 45 cm / 18 inches) help them pluck leaves
            from thorny acacia trees, their favorite food. Despite their height,
            giraffes only need 5–30 minutes of sleep per day, often standing up
            to avoid predators.
          </p>
          <p>
            Giraffes are social but loosely structured, living in fluid herds
            that change frequently. Males, called bulls, engage in "necking"
            battles to establish dominance, swinging their heavy heads and
            ossicone-covered skulls like clubs. Females, or cows, are highly
            protective of their calves, which can stand within 30 minutes of
            birth.
          </p>
          <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
          <p>
            You can observe these graceful giants in Pen E18, near the savannah
            exhibit.
