          <h3>MONKEY</h3>
          <p>
            The Monkey is a highly intelligent and agile primate belonging to
            the suborder Haplorhini, with over 260 known species found across
            tropical and subtropical regions worldwide. Monkeys are divided into
            two main groups: Old World monkeys (Africa and Asia) with narrow
            noses and non-prehensile tails, and New World monkeys (Americas)
            with flat noses and often long, grasping tails. These social
            creatures display remarkable adaptability, living in diverse
            habitats from rainforests to savannas and even urban areas.
          </p>
          <p>
            Monkeys vary dramatically in size, from the tiny Pygmy Marmoset
            (just 100 grams) to the large Mandrill (weighing up to 50 kg). Most
            species are omnivorous, eating fruits, leaves, insects, and
            occasionally small animals. Their dexterous hands and opposable
            thumbs allow them to skillfully manipulate objects, use tools, and
            even exhibit problem-solving abilities rivaling great apes.

          <p>
            Living in complex social hierarchies, monkeys communicate through
            vocalizations, facial expressions, and body language. Some species
            like Japanese Macaques are known for unique cultural behaviors, such
            as bathing in hot springs. Unfortunately, many monkey species face
            threats from habitat destruction, hunting, and the illegal pet
            trade, with some critically endangered.
