          <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
          <p>
            The Gemsbok (Oryx gazella) is a striking antelope species belonging
            to the family Bovidae. Known for its elegant, long horns and
            distinctive black-and-white facial markings, the Gemsbok is a true
            icon of the African desert and savannah. Both males and females
            possess these impressive horns, which can grow up to 85 cm (33
            inches) in length.
          </p>
          <p>
            Gemsbok are well-adapted to arid environments, such as the Kalahari
            and Namib Deserts, where they can survive without water for long
            periods by extracting moisture from the plants they eat. Their pale,
            grayish-brown coat reflects sunlight, helping them stay cool, while
            their black markings reduce glare and enhance camouflage.
          </p>

            These antelopes are highly social, often forming herds of 10â€“40
            individuals, though older males may become solitary. They are
            primarily grazers, feeding on grasses, leaves, and wild melons, but
            can also dig for roots and tubers when food is scarce.
          </p>
          <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
          <p>
            You can observe the majestic Gemsbok in Pen D15, near the desert
            exhibit area.
