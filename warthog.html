          <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
          <p>
            The Warthog (Phacochoerus africanus) is a wild member of the pig
            family, famous for its tough, wrinkly skin, curved tusks, and
            comical sprint with its tail held high like a flag. Native to the
            grasslands, savannas, and woodlands of sub-Saharan Africa, these
            resilient animals thrive in harsh environments where many others
            struggle.
          </p>
          <p>
            Warthogs are omnivorous, using their snouts to dig for roots, bulbs,
            and even small animals. They rely on wallows to cool off and mud
            baths to protect against sunburn and parasites.
